# Final Project â€“ Web Portfolio for 23W_MTM6201_030 Web Development II

## Introduction

The purpose of a web portfolio can vary from person to person. Maybe it is to get a job, promote your brand, experiment with new technology, or simply showcase what you can do. Whatever purpose you may have, it is important to have a web portfolio.

## Objective

For this project, you will use the mockups, wireframes and design elements you create in your User Experience Design course, as a guideline to create your Web Portfolio or Personal Business site. You will create a Web Portfolio or Personal Business site using the Bootstrap framework. This will be YOUR portfolio. It should reflect who you are and what you can do. It may contain as many or as few pages as you wish. Your web portfolio should contain a collection of work that you have done and wish to share with the world.

## My Process
## The Challenges (I faced during development and how you overcame those changes)
## What I learned by creating this web portfolio
## List of assets or resources used (that was not my own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images) 

## TODO LIST
### Main Page
- [x] try using maggy img in red with different blending mode (Fix #1)
- [x] fix bottom of page; page length do to image repositioning (Fix #2)
- [x] create two-img
- [x] remove footer background image & h1
- [ ] resize for different screens/ make media queries
### Secondary Pages
- [ ] make work page
- [ ] make about page
- [ ] make contact page

### Requirements To Do

- [x] Create a new repository folder named portfolio
- [x] Add me (@ProfJoanna) as a collaborator on GitHub
- [ ] Follow the convention for adding file and folder names. All lowercase including file extensions, no special characters, no spaces, must start with a letter, and may use hyphens or underscores.
- [x] You must use the Bootstrap framework for building your portfolio.
- [ ] Utilize CSS variables to customize the default colour scheme of Bootstrap.
- [ ] Your design must be optimized for a variety of screen sizes.
- [ ] Your design should strive to meet accessibility standards. This should include semantic markup in a logical order, readable text, alternative text for visual elements, and functional using only the keyboard. ARIA roles, Schema, and skip links as required.
---
- [ ] You must use one publicly available CSS library in addition to the Bootstrap framework. You may also use a JavaScript library for functionality. See the list of CSS libraries.
---
- [ ] If you choose to use web fonts, which is encouraged, use only fonts that you have the right to use, for example, Google fonts.
- [x] All text, images, illustrations, videos, or any other asset, must be your own where possible. If you are using any stock images please identify them, in the README.md file. No copyrighted materials.
- [ ] Make sure that any images and illustrations are optimized, and that they respond (grow and shrink) to the layout. Create a minimum of two sizes of your images and utilize <picture> tag and srcset, sizes, and media attributes as needed.
- [ ] Create a README.md file and save it at the root of your site. In the readme file add information assuming that you are asked to explain the following about your portfolio in an interview, "Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?" Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. 
- [ ] You will need to use the markdown language to format your README.md file.
- [ ] Your web portfolio MUST be published on the GitHub Pages site. This means going to http://your-username.github.io/portfolio will display your web portfolio.
